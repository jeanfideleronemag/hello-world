# hello-world

Hello whoever reads this!

I'm creating a new github because my current work assignment has absolutely no version control and it's not something I want to manage on my work laptop. 

I like walking up Woodward Ave to the Avalon Bakery for the daily soup and a few slices of fresh bread.

Have a nice day!

Jean
